/// Why this exists: without ffmpeg the app reads 16 kHz mono WAV and nothing else, which is not
/// what anyone has on disk. Telling a new user to go and find ffmpeg themselves before the app
/// will open an MP3 is a wall most people will not climb, and it made the product page's claims
/// untrue out of the box.
///
/// Why it is downloaded rather than bundled:
///
/// 1. **Licence.** The build is GPL. ffmpeg is run as a separate process and never linked, which
///    keeps its terms off this application. Shipping the binary inside our installer would make
///    us a redistributor of GPL software and drag in obligations we have not signed up to.
///    Fetching it from its own publisher, at the user's request, does not.
/// 2. **Size.** It is over 100 MB, several times the installer. Most of that is codecs a given
///    user will never touch.
///
/// The archive is pinned to an exact version and checked against a known SHA-256 before anything
/// is extracted. A moving "latest" URL cannot be verified, so it is not used.
